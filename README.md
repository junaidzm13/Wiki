# Wiki

### Developed, designed and implemented a wikipedia-like online encyclopedia.


### Background
As most of us know, [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) is a free online encyclopedia that contains a number of encyclopedia entries on numerous subjects.

Each encyclopedia entry has its own page and it can be viewed by visiting the entry's page. For example, visiting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML shows the Wikipedia entry for HTML.

In practice, it would start to get tedious if every page on Wikipedia had to be written in HTML. Instead, it is much more helpful to store encyclopedia entries using a lighter-weight human-friendly markup language. Wikipedia happens to use a markup language called [Wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext), but for this project we store encyclopedia entries using a markup language called Markdown.

Read through [GitHub’s Markdown guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to get an understanding for more information and how Markdown’s syntax works.

By having single Markdown file for each encyclopedia entry, we made our entries much more user-friendly to write and edit.
